# Potential Issues When Using It

Reduced Speed: Despite choosing the closest proxy server, you might encounter slow speeds. Given that it's a free service, there may not be sufficient funds to maintain and acquire high-quality IP resources.

Frequent Disconnections: While browsing, you might experience frequent disconnections, which can be quite annoying. You may need to switch to a server in a different location, and it might take multiple tries to find a working one.

Excessive Ads: This is understandable as it's a free service that needs to generate revenue for its upkeep. However, these ads can sometimes block crucial information, making accidental clicks easy.

Limited Availability of Locations: Although there seems to be a variety of locations to choose from, not all may be operational for you. Each time you use the service, you'll need to test each location to find a functioning server.

Potential Risks: As per its privacy policy, third-party advertising partners may use cookies or web beacons to gather your information. This indicates a potential risk concerning your privacy and data security.
